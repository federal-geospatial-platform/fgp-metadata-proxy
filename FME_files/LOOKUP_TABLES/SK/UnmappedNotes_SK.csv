287612147ab4f0a9863148f76170f00,"The Saskatchewan Digital Land Cover was created to be used in the interim. The National Land Cover Project plans to integrate land cover information compiled by Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
The Saskatchewan Digital Land Cover raster provides a seamless provincial coverage of the province and was created by combining the Saskatchewan Research Council's Northern Digital Land Cover (NDLC) with the Southern Digital Land Cover (SDLC) - See enclosures for complete metadata on these datasets. With exception to the SDLC's value 2 (i.e. Hay Crops) and value 3 (i.e. Native Dominant Grass Lands), the NDLC takes precedence over the SDLC in areas that the two rasters overlap because the NDLC is more current than the dated SDLC. The SDLC's values 2 and 3 were preserved because these land covers are not specifically represented in the NDLC. For the purpose of this dataset, some of the SDLC and NDLC values were reclassified to new values to reconcile varying definitions (i.e. See the Supplementary Information section below for a complete list of image classes with detailed descriptions). A unique colourmap was created for this dataset. It should also be noted that because the NDLC's 30 x 30 metre pixels do not align with the SDLC's 30 x 30 metre pixels, this raster was snapped to the NDLC. Last, as is with the SDLC and the NDLC, the extent of this raster does not extend all of the way to the Saskatchewan boundary, specifically, the Information Services Corporation's SaskGIS Provincial Boundary dataset, in numerous areas along the west, south and southeast borders: There are gaps of up to 500 m wide of no data between the provincial boundary and the raster along these areas of the Saskatchewan boundary."

Wildlife Management Zones (WMZ) are used for the management of wildlife, mainly game species, in the Province of Saskatchewan. Hunting activities are governed and wildlife populations (inventories) are monitored using these zones. These assigned zone boundaries help address the wildlife management issues of the day and are subject to change as wildlife populations and management practices evolve. The last revision to the WMZ boundaries was March 27, 2014. This revision moves some boundaries to readily identifiable landmarks such as numbered highways, municipal roads or water bodies for ease of public use. Descriptions are written in a manner that better allows boundaries to follow highway or provincial forest boundary updates without ammending the regulation. These boundaries are described legally in the Wildlife Management Zones and Special Areas Boundaries Regulations, 1990 (shortened to WMZSABR for dataset naming). These regulations are in force under The Wildlife Act, 1998. Copies of these documents can be found at www.qp.gov.sk.ca.
This spatial feature class is the polygon representation of the zones as described in the regulation. Although these digitized boundaries are intended to be as accurate as possible, the regulations supersede this data should discrepancies occur.
The polygons you see here are constructed from the lines contained in the WMZ framework feature class, which is a clause by clause representation of the legal regulation. Regulation changes to the zones, when they occur, should be digitized in the framework first, and then constructed into polygons for this feature class.

CHMAs are not intended to be in these fixed locations in perpetuity and may change locations on the landscape in response to habitat disturbance recovery, wildfire, changes in land use, and woodland caribou population trends. Different management actions and strategies will be developed for each Tier based on their stated management objectives and relative importance to and known use by caribou, current habitat condition and potential risks.
